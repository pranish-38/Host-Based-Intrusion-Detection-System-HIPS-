📚 Theoretical Overview
What is a Host-based Intrusion Prevention System?
A Host-based Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) is a security application that monitors a single host (computer) for malicious activity and can take action to prevent or stop attacks. Unlike network-based systems (NIPS), HIPS operates at the endpoint level, providing deep visibility into host behavior.
